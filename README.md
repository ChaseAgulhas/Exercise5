# Shopping List Program

##The Story
Many times I have found myself wrtiting up grocery lists (whether it be for myself or for family members) and the moment I get to the desired store I am completely lost. I have no idea where to locate the items on the list and this forces me to ask the aisle assistants for direciton or stick to my stubborn nature and walk around the shop extremely confused until I manage to miraculously stumble upon the item that I need. Therefore I decided to write a program that would double up as a shopping list but also as a navigator.

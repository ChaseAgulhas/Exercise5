#PickMe

##The Story
Many times I have found myself wrtiting up grocery lists (whether it be for myself or for family members) and the moment I get to the desired store I am completely lost. I have no idea where to locate the items on the list and this forces me to ask the aisle assistants for direciton or stick to my stubborn nature and walk around the shop extremely confused until I manage to miraculously stumble upon the item that I need. Therefore I decided to write a program that would double up as a shopping list but also as a navigator. Hopefully this program will be able to assist those that have no clue what they are doing when the put foot into a grocery mall.

##The Domain Model of the Shopping list program (PickMe)
Below is a copy of the domain model for the shopping list program.

PickMe allows users to be either registered customers or non-registered. This ensures that customers will have free access to this handy assistant without the need to feel like they need to sign up to any shop to be able to use the program. However it does allow registered users to have access to the shop's various rewards that it might offer to registered users. You will be able to add items to the list and edit it accordingly. The items on the list will have a location attached to it and this will be able to direct the user to each item individually.
